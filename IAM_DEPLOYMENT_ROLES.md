# AWS IAM Role and Resource Setup
In order to be able to leverage the GitHub action deployment for your API and Lambda serverless function implementing the API, a few IAM roles and an S3 bucket resource need to be setup. Following the setup, the respective ARNs can be added to the environmental variables for your forked repository.

Overview of roles / resources to be created
| Name      | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| S3 Bucket      | Resource | The S3 bucket with store the code artifacts during deployment (e.g., the Lambda function code) |
| LambdaExecutionRole | Role | The role that will execute the deployed lambda function |
| CloudFormationRole   | Role | This role is where the permissions for deploying the application-specific resources are defined within AWS IAM |
| PipelineExecutionRole | Role | This role is assumed by the principal who is initiating the deployment process |

The resources and roles below can be created via the AWS admin console or CLI. The instructions describe the steps via the admin console.

### Step 1 - Create S3 Bucket

Create an S3 bucket as follows:
- Navigate to the **S3** service
- Click **Create bucket**
- Name the bucket uniquely and choose the appropriate _AWS Region_
- Keep remaining default settings and click **Create bucket**

> **Tip** Keep note of the name and ARN for the created S3 bucket as you'll need it later

_We'll come back and adjust permissions in a later step!_

### Step 2 - Create a LambdaExecutionRole
- Navigate to the **IAM** service and choose **Roles** in the Access Management pane (or via _Top Features_ menu)
- Click **Create role**
- Choose **AWS service** as the _Trusted entity type_ and **Lambda** as the _Use case_ (note we'll be overriding this anyway)
- Click **Next**
- On the _Add permissions_ page, search for `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`, select it and click **Next**
- Enter a role name (e.g. `books-api-dev-bookstorefunction`)
- Click **Create role**

> **Tip** Keep note of the ARN for the created role as you'll need it later

### Step 3 - Create a CloudFormationRole

Create a new IAM role as follows:
- Navigate to the **IAM** service and choose **Roles** in the Access Management pane (or via _Top Features_ menu)
- Click **Create role**
- Choose **AWS service** as the _Trusted entity type_ and **CloudFormation** as the _Use case_
- Click **Next**
- On the _Add permissions_ page click **Next**
- On the _Role details_ page, enter a meaningful name in the Role name input (e.g. `aws-actions-dev-CloudFormationExecutionRole`)
- Click **Create role**
- Open the role details again, and click on **Add permissions** > **Create inline policy**
- Choose the **JSON** tab, and paste the following
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": "*",
                "Resource": "*",
                "Effect": "Allow"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
- Click **Review policy** and then choose an appropriate policy name (e.g. `GrantCloudFormationFullAccess`)
- Click **Create policy**

> **Tip** Keep note of the ARN for the created role as you'll need it later

### Step 4 - Create a PipelineExecutionRole

Create a new IAM role as follows:
- Navigate to the **IAM** service and choose **Roles** in the Access Management pane (or via _Top Features_ menu)
- Click **Create role**
- Choose **AWS service** as the _Trusted entity type_ and **Lambda** as the _Use case_ (note we'll be overriding this anyway)
- Click **Next**
- On the _Add permissions_  click **Next**
- On the _Role details_ page, enter a meaningful name in the Role name input (e.g. `aws-actions-dev-PipelineExecutionRole`)
- Update the default description to something more meaningful (e.g. `This role is assumed by the principal who is initiating the deployment process`)
- Click **Create role**
- Open the role details again, and click on **Add permissions** > **Create inline policy**
- Choose the **JSON** tab, and paste the following:
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": "iam:PassRole",
                "Resource": "<PUT ARN OF ROLE FROM STEP 3 HERE>",
                "Effect": "Allow"
            },
            {
                "Action": [
                    "cloudformation:CreateChangeSet",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet",
                    "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet",
                    "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                    "cloudformation:GetTemplate",
                    "cloudformation:GetTemplateSummary",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeStackResource"
                ],
                "Resource": "*",
                "Effect": "Allow"
            },
            {
                "Action": [
                    "s3:DeleteObject",
                    "s3:GetObject*",
                    "s3:PutObject*",
                    "s3:GetBucket*",
                    "s3:List*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>/*",
                    "<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow"
            },
            {
                "Action": [
                    "iam:Get*",
                    "iam:List*",
                    "iam:CreateRole",
                    "iam:DeleteRole",
                    "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                    "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                    "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                    "iam:TagRole",
                    "iam:UntagRole"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "<PUT ARN OF LAMBDA ROLE FROM STEP 2 HERE>"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF ROLE FROM STEP 3 HERE>` string with the ARN from the CloudFormationRole created in step 3
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>` strings with the ARN of the S3 bucket created in step 1
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF LAMBDA ROLE FROM STEP 2 HERE>` string the ARN from the LambdaExecutionRole created in step 2
- Click **Review policy** and then choose an appropriate policy name (e.g. `PipelineExecutionRolePermissions`)
- Click **Create policy**
- Choose **Trust relationships** and click **Edit trust policy**
- Paste in the following JSON:
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "<PUT ARN OF appropriate IAM pipeline user here>"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
- Create an IAM user with programmatic access and set up appropriate security credentials. See [creating IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) and [create access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) for more information
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF appropriate IAM pipeline user here>` string with the user URN bound to the AWS credentials. We'll add the credentials to the repository secrets in _step 6_
- Click **Update policy**

> **Tip** Keep note of the ARN for the created role as you'll need it later

### Step 5 - Allow appropriate access to S3 bucket

Now we're going to allow access to the S3 bucket created in step 1, but limit access to the _CloudFormationRole_ and _PipelineExecutionRole_ created in steps 3 and 4.

- Navigate to the **S3** service, and choose **Buckets** (either from _Amazon S3_ menu pane or from the _Top Features_ shortcut menu)
- Open the S3 bucket created in **Step 1** above
- Choose the **Permissions** tab
- Click **Edit** within the _Block public access (bucket settings)_ and **uncheck** the _Block all public access' checkbox
- Click **Save changes** 
- Enter `confirm` into the prompt dialog and click **Confirm**
- Click **Edit** within the _Bucket policy_ section
- Paste the following and then replace the relevant strings:
```
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>/*",
                "<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "<PUT ARN OF ROLE FROM STEP 3 HERE>",
                    "<PUT ARN OF ROLE FROM STEP 4 HERE>"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject*",
                "s3:PutObject*",
                "s3:GetBucket*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>/*",
                "<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF S3 FROM STEP 1 HERE>` strings with the ARN of the S3 bucket created in step 1 (this is the ARN of the bucket you're editing)
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF ROLE FROM STEP 3 HERE>` string with the ARN from the CloudFormationRole created in step 3
- Replace the `<PUT ARN OF ROLE FROM STEP 4 HERE>` string the ARN from the PipelineExecutionRole created in step 4
- Click **Save changes**

### Step 6 - Update the Actions, secrets and variable for your forked repository

#### Add the appropriate AWS credentials to repository secrets
- Within your forked repository,navigate to **Settings**
- From the left-hand navigation pane, navigate to _Security > Secrets and variables > Actions_
- Set up two secrets called `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the appropriate key credentials from the AWS user

Follow the [principle of least privileges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) guide.

#### Replace the appropriate environment variables within the GitHub Action
- Within your forked repository,navigate to **Settings**
- From the left-hand navigation pane, navigate to _Security > Secrets and variables > Actions_
- Choose the **Variables** tab and add the following variables

| Name      | Value | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| PIPELINE_EXECUTION_ROLE | Put in the **ARN** from the PipelineExecutionRole created in step 4 |
| CLOUDFORMATION_EXECUTION_ROLE | Put in **ARN** from the CloudFormationRole created in step 3 |
| ARTIFACTS_BUCKET | Put in **NAME** of the S3 bucket created in step 1 |
| AWS_REGION | Put in the region (e.g., `eu-west-1`) you want the resources to be created in |
